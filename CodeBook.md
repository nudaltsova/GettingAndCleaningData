# CodeBook

This code book describes variables, data transformations and work 
performed on the raw data set to clean it up as per assignment requirements.

Sections below do not describe data but only changes made, please refer to the original cook book for detailed description of data

## Transformations
The target of the ercersise was to merge data from various files and data sets (merge both vertically and horizontally) and select a subset of features as per specified pattern; The resulting data set was then averaged by sme features


Detailed Steps:

1. Read features file, subset only those matching 'mean' or 'std'

2. Normalize feature names

3. Read activities file

4. Normalize activities names

5. Read 'test' dataset: y_test -> activityId; subject_test -> subjectId; x_test -> feature measures
  
6. Subset feature measures by feature name (see step 1)

7. Merge (vertically, cbind) y_test, activities, subject_test and subset of feature measures

8. Repeat 5-7 for train dataset

9. Merge (horizontally, rbind) test and train datasets

10. Aggregate merged data by activity and subject

## Normalized Names

The following normalization was applied:

* dash removed: **yy-X** -> to *yyX*

* brackets removed: **yyy()** -> *yyy*

* duplicates removed: **YyyYyy** -> *Yyy*

* lowercasing: **YYY** -> *yyy*
